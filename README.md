# Hand-Landmark-Detection
# Hybrid Joint and Hand Landmark Detection

# Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time joint and hand landmark detection system** using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It tracks full-body joints (pose estimation) and detects **hand landmarks (fingertips, wrist, etc.)** to analyze movements and potential tremors.

# Features
- **Real-time body joint detection** using MediaPipe Pose.
- **Hand landmark detection** for precise finger tracking.
- **Tremor detection** by analyzing movement variance in hands and arms.
- **Live visualization** with OpenCV and Streamlit for an interactive UI.
- **Angle calculation** for elbow movement analysis.

# Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV** - Real-time image processing.
- **MediaPipe** - Pose and Hand landmark tracking.
- **Streamlit** - Web-based UI for visualization.
- **NumPy** - Mathematical computations.
- **Deque** - Efficient movement tracking.
